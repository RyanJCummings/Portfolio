# Full Stack Web App Example

This is a simple web app designed to demonstrate front-end, back-end, and simple API development.
The inspiration for this comes from tabletop roleplaying games. It provides a random
roll generator based on the number and type of dice required for a roll. Additionally,
rolls for a session will be stored in a noSQL database and returned upon making a history
request. Future work will create a more pleasant user interface and provide statistics and
visualization of roll history. This app is very early in development. 
I will provide updates as it progresses.
