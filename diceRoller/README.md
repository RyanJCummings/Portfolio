# Full Stack Web App Example

This is a simple web app designed to demonstrate front-end, back-end, and API development.
I chose to use Kotlin with Spring Boot and Gradle because I'm interested in learning Kotlin
for mobile, api, and microservices development.  These topics are all new to me so this is
mainly a fun way to explore. The inspiration for this particular web app comes from tabletop 
roleplaying games. It provides a random roll generator based on the number 
and type of dice required for a roll. Additionally,rolls for a session will be stored in a 
noSQL database and returned upon making a history request. Future work will 
create a more pleasant user interface and provide statistics and visualization of roll 
history. This app is very early in development. I will provide updates as it progresses.
