# diceRoller

### Author: Ryan Cummings

This project is a simple web app implementing a dice roller for a standard Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Mostly this is to experiment with Kotlin and Spring Boot for API development. A dice roller is not unique however it provides a nice project learn Kotlin and handle multiple types of HTTP Requests/Responses. The project is a natural extension of my school work, which largely ignored server-side programming, to showcase my interest in full-stack development.

This currently exposes API endpoints to handle basic dice roll randomization. The corresponding API client is currently in development. This project is not yet hosted on a public server. Please check back soon for more updates.

This has much room to grow and future work could include user login, persistence, data analysis, and visualization of statistics.
