# diceRoller

### Author: Ryan Cummings

This project is a simple web app implementing a dice roller for a standard Dungeons and Dragons campaign. Mostly this is to experiment with Kotlin and Spring Boot for API development. A dice roller is not unique however it provides a nice project learn Kotlin and handle multiple types of HTTP Requests/Responses. The project is a natural extension of my school work, which largely ignored server-side programming, to showcase my interest in full-stack development.

The minimum viable product will be a very simple client in which the user specifies the type and number of dice to be rolled. The backend handles the roll and returns the results to the client. The project is close to initial release with a target date of April 5th, 2021.

This has much room to grow and future work could include user login, persistence, data analysis, and visualization of statistics.
